Waifu Clicker is a mobile app for Android version 19 or higher.



## Introduction
This project have been made for school where the goal was to create a Clicker game.
Clicker game is a game where you can click and get points.
For now 3 games mode are available.

## Games Mode
    # Normal Mode
    In this mode you can click and get points, nothing else for the moment.

    # Infernal Mode
    In this mode you can click and get points but you need to click faster on the time because your point is decreasing each second in function of you current score.

    # Speed Mode
    You have 10 seconds to click the maximum of times you can on the picture.

**You can share you score with friends by clicking on it in the leaderboard.**

## Upcoming updates

    # New game mode
    # More waifus
    # Special power for each waifu

Feel free to give your opinion about the app and on what it can be improved.

*The code is messy for the moment. I will try my best to refactor and put it in a clean way.*
